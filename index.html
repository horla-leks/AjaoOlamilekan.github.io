									<h2>Datarlyst<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Ajao Olamilekan, and I work remotely as a data analyst. I hold a degree in B.Eng Materials and Metallurgical Engineering(University of Ilorin). As a result of the pandemic period and a persistent strike of the lecturer bodies, which was consecutive, put a halt on my pursuit of a degree, which made me transition into the world of data analytics. 
										<br />
										<br />
									   I am a dedicated and results-driven individual with a solid materials and metallurgical engineering foundation, complemented by a keen aptitude for data analysis. My academic background has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of materials science, process engineering, and metallurgical principles, fostering a meticulous and analytical approach to problem-solving.
									   To further emphasize my problem-solving skills, I created this website portfolio, which was done with no prior knowledge of web development; it was a problem at the time, but I solved it with all the resources at my disposal.</p>

									<p>As the world grappled with an unprecedented global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019
										 brought many challenges and complexities. This novel coronavirus, officially named SARS-CoV-2, swiftly 
										 traversed borders, impacting communities, economies, and healthcare systems on an unparalleled scale. 
										 In the face of this crisis, data analysis has become an invaluable tool for understanding the dynamics 
										 of the pandemic, revealing insights into its spread, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. 
										 I delved into a short analysis of the COVID-19 dataset from ourworldindata.org, aiming to extract 
										 meaningful patterns and trends contributing to our collective understanding of this historic event. 
										 All research and visuals here were done through the R programming language.</p>

									<p>IBM Cognos Analytics is a business intelligence and analytics platform developed by IBM. It is designed to help organizations extract insights from their data and make informed business decisions. I utilized the predictive analytics feature of IBM Cognos Analytics for predictive analytics on the platform. This feature allows users to build and deploy predictive models to make data-driven forecasts and predictions. The iris dataset, which contains features like sepal length, sepal width, and petal width, was used for this visualization. The target variable is the iris species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)..</p>

									<p>The dataset used for this Excel analysis was collected from a company that buys three primary fuels,
										 P.M.S, A.G.O, and D.P.K, from the depot, then transport them to various filling station upon demand,
										  which is then sold to the final consumers.<br />
										 The company stores its data in hardcopy form; 
										 I collected the hardcopy and entered it into Excel. The data entered contained six variables: 
										 the “loading date,” which is the date loading of fuel into a truck from a particular depot takes 
										 place before it is transported to its destination; the “depot” is the storage facility where the fuel 
										 to be transported is gotten from; the “truck number” identifies the truck used to transport a particular 
										 loaded fuel; the “fuel” represents the type of fuel to be transported; the “liter” is the amount of fuel 
										 being transported in liters; and the “delivery location” is the place where the loaded fuel is to be delivered.
										 Data analysis was done and visualized using Excel, and the key visuals were used to create the dashboard. 
										 This was the first project I ever completed as a data analyst.

									<p>The “Sales Records" dataset is also a public dataset downloaded from Kaggle. My goal is to understand the data, get some context, and understand the variables and the relationships between them by employing data visualization techniques to draw meaningful patterns and insights with the help of Tableau. A dashboard was also created. The filter feature was used on the dashboard for more interaction with the dashboard.</p>
